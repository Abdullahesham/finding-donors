# finding-donors

 ## Overview
  * In this project I employed (Na√Øve Bayes, Decision Tree, AdaBoost) models using sklearn, python library, to help CharityML find donors and whom should they reach out to begin with.
  * I also Optimized one of these models to enhance the accuracy and performance of the model

 ## Installation  
  * You can use google colab to run this code online [https://colab.research.google.com/]
  * To run this code on your local machine
	  * You will need to install jupyter notebook
	  * You also need to install python 
	  * Download visuals.py file [https://github.com/Abdullahesham/finding-donors]
 
 ## common bugs
  One of  common bugs that may face you is  
   ```
  import visuals as vs
  
**ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'visuals'**
```
* There are many solution to  solve this issue, one of them is to download 'visuals.py' file  in the same folder of your code, you can download from [https://github.com/Abdullahesham/finding-donors]

 ## What might take time to understand ? 
  * You may need to understand the main idea of applied algorithms before writing and running code
  * You may also need to take a look at sklearn library and read how functions documentations, this link will help you [https://scikit-learn.org/stable/]
